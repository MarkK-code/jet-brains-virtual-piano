## Small project on creating virtual piano 

Here are some basics for front-end developer which were on hyperskills webpage.
During this project I wrote markup HTML document and most popular CSS properties. There is also used basic JavaScript with handles for browser events.

In general there is part of piano keyboard which user can play by pressing keys.
